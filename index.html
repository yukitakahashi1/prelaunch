				I am a Max Weber Fellow at the <a href="https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/department-of-economics" target="_blank">European University Institute</a>.
				I am an applied microeconomist working in the areas of Behavioral Economics, Gender Economics, and Labor Economics. 
			</p>
			<p>
				My research examines how biases, stereotypes, and institutions distort individual behavior and organizational efficiency, 
				and proposes effective policy solutions. I primarily rely on the use of laboratory and field experiments 
				to carefully investigate the underlying psychological mechanisms behind the various distortions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I received my PhD in Economics from the 
				<a href="https://phd.unibo.it/economics/en" target="_blank">University of Bologna</a> in July 2022.

	Collaboration is an integral component of workplace environments, but it also involves correcting one's colleagues. Using a quasi-laboratory experiment, I study whether people dislike collaborating with someone who corrects them and whether men dislike women's correction more in a gender-neutral environment. I find that people are less willing to collaborate with others who have corrected them, even if the correction improved group performance. High-ability people also respond negatively to corrections, suggesting that the negative response is unlikely due to their misunderstanding of correction quality. Yet, I do not find consistent evidence that men (or women) dislike women's corrections more and that they believe there are no gender differences in ability. These findings suggest that a behavioral bias distorts the selection of talent and penalizes those who correct others' mistakes, but the gender of the corrector does not matter in a gender-neutral environment and task.

<h4> <a href="files/DVRussia.pdf" target="_blank"><b>The Welfare Effects of Increased Legal Tolerance toward Domestic Violence</b></a>, submitted

<p id="dvrussia" style="display: none; text-align: justify; font-size:0.9em" class="well">
	The decision to arrest men who abuse their partner is often at the police officers' discretion, especially when the abuse is not serious. However, such light abuse may accumulate and deteriorate women's welfare. This paper uses Russia's criminal law reform that decriminalized light domestic and non-domestic violence as a natural experiment to study the effect of decriminalization of light intimate partner violence on married women's welfare. Using difference-in-differences and flexibly controlling for macroeconomic shocks with unmarried women as a control group, I find that the reform decreased married women's life satisfaction and increased depression. The effect size is similar for college-educated women and women in high-qualified occupations who may be more sensitive to general violence norms. The likely mechanism is that the reform muted married women because the law no longer protected them from their partners' light abuses: while unmarried women began to express less tolerance toward intimate partner violence, married women did not. Also, married or unmarried men did not change their tolerance significantly, suggesting that the effect is women-specific. These findings suggest that decriminalizing intimate partner violence decreases married women's welfare, even if it is a light one, and highlights the importance of legal institutions in harnessing intimate partner violence.

	Cognitive skills are an important personal attribute that affects career success. However, colleagues' support is also 
	vital as most works are done in groups, and the degree of their support is influenced by their generosity. Social norms 
	enter in groups, and gender may interact with cognitive skills through gender norms in society. Because these gender norms 
	penalize women with high potential, they can reduce colleagues' generosity towards these women. Using a novel experimental 
	design where I exogenously vary gender and cognitive skills and sufficiently powered analysis, I find neither the two 
	attributes nor their interactions affect other people's generosity; if anything, people are more generous to women with 
	high potential. I argue that my findings have implications for the role of gender norms in labor markets.

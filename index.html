<h4> <a href="files/Correction.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Gender Differences in the Cost of Corrections in Group Work</b></a> (Job Market Paper)

<p id="correction" style="display: none; text-align: justify; font-size:0.9em">
	Corrections among colleagues are an integral part of group work, but people may take corrections as personal criticism, 
	especially corrections by women. I study whether people dislike collaborating with someone who corrects them and more so 
	when that person is a woman. Using a novel quasi-laboratory experiment, I find that people, including those with high 
	productivity, are less willing to collaborate with a person who has corrected them even if the correction improves group 
	performance. Yet, I do not find robust evidence that people respond more negatively to women's corrections, and this is 
	not driven by their beliefs about the difference in women's and men's abilities. These findings suggest that although women
	may not receive a stronger negative reaction, there is a behavioral bias that distorts the optimal selection of talents and 
	penalizes those who correct others' mistakes.

<h4> <a href="files/CareerProgression.pdf" target="_blank"><b>The Role of Gender and Cognitive Skills on Other People's Generosity</b></a>
	<a href="#/" onclick="visib('careerprog')" class="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://osf.io/r6d8f/files" target="_blank" class="button">Pre-analysis plan</a> </h4>
<p id="careerprog" style="display: none; text-align: justify; font-size:0.9em">
	Cognitive skills are an important personal attribute that affects career success. However, colleagues' support is also 
	vital as most works are done in groups, and the degree of their support is influenced by their generosity. Social norms 
	enter in groups, and gender may interact with cognitive skills through gender norms in society. Because these gender norms 
	penalize women with high potential, they can reduce colleagues' generosity towards these women. Using a novel experimental 
	design where I exogenously vary gender and cognitive skills and sufficiently powered analysis, I find neither the two 
	attributes nor their interactions affect other people's generosity; if anything, people are more generous to women with 
	high potential. I argue that my findings have implications for the role of gender norms in labor markets.

<h4> <a href="files/DVRussia.pdf" target="_blank"><b>The Welfare Effects of Increased Legal Tolerance toward Domestic Violence</b></a>
	<a href="#/" onclick="visib('dvrussia')" class="button">Abstract</a> </h4>
<p id="dvrussia" style="display: none; text-align: justify; font-size:0.9em">
	This paper studies how increased legal tolerance toward domestic violence affects married women's welfare using 
	the domestic violence decriminalization bill introduced to the Russian national congress in 2016. Using 
	difference-in-differences and flexibly controlling for macroeconomic shocks, I find that the bill decreased
	married women's life satisfaction and increased depression, especially among those with a college degree and 
	a highly qualified white-collar occupation who are supposed to be more sensitive to gender regressive atmosphere. 
	Consistent with this conjecture, people became more tolerant toward general and domestic violence after the bill. 
	These findings suggest that the bill reduced married women's welfare partly through the gender regressive atmosphere.

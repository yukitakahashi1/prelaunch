				I am a PhD candidate in economics at the <a href="https://phd.unibo.it/economics/en" target="_blank">University of Bologna</a>.
				I work on topics in behavioral and gender economics with a particular focus on inequality.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my job market paper, I study whether people dislike collaborating with someone who corrects them and more so when that person is a woman.

<h4> <a href="files/Correction.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Gender Differences in the Cost of Corrections in Group Work</b></a> (Job Market Paper)
	<br><div style="margin-left:1em"><a href="#/" onclick="visib('correction')">Abstract <small>(click to expand)</small></a>, <a href="https://osf.io/tgyc5" target="_blank">Pre-analysis plan</a></div> </h4>
<p id="correction" style="display: none; text-align: justify">
Corrections among colleagues are an integral part of group work, but people may take corrections as personal criticism, especially corrections by women. I study whether people dislike collaborating with someone who corrects them and more so when that person is a woman. Using a novel quasi-laboratory experiment, I find that people, including those with high productivity, are less willing to collaborate with a person who has corrected them even if the correction improves group performance. Yet, I do not find robust evidence that people respond more negatively to women's corrections, and this is not driven by their beliefs about the difference in women's and men's abilities. These findings suggest that although women may not receive a stronger negative reaction, there is a behavioral bias that distorts the optimal selection of talents and penalizes those who correct others' mistakes.

<h4> <a href="files/CareerProgression.pdf" target="_blank"><b>The Role of Gender and Cognitive Skills on Other People's Generosity</b></a>
	<br><div style="margin-left:1em"><a href="#/" onclick="visib('careerprog')">Abstract <small>(click to expand)</small></a>, <a href="https://osf.io/r6d8f/files" target="_blank">Pre-analysis plan</a></div> </h4>
<p id="careerprog" style="display: none; text-align: justify">
Cognitive skills are an important personal attribute that affects career success. However, colleagues' support is also vital as most works are done in groups, and the degree of their support is influenced by their generosity. Social norms enter in groups, and gender may interact with cognitive skills through gender norms in society. Because these gender norms penalize women with high potential, they can reduce colleagues' generosity towards these women. Using a novel experimental design where I exogenously vary gender and cognitive skills and sufficiently powered analysis, I find neither the two attributes nor their interactions affect other people's generosity; if anything, people are more generous to women with high potential. I argue that my findings have implications for the role of gender norms in labor markets.
